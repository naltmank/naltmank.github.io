    "section": "Research Interests",
    "text": "Research Interests\nWhile my interests are broad, I tend to take an experimental approach to understand how interactions between corals, algae, and fish are affected by stressors at global and local scales. Oftentimes this means spending long days swimming around the lagoons of Mo’orea, French Polynesia, where I conduct most of my work."
